          ðŸ¤šHi, my name is Daniel Lake, I am a Jr Web Developer, 
          and I have been creating websites on my own for about 7 years. 
          ðŸ’»It started using WordPress themes for a business I owned. 
          I then began to focus more of my own time on educating myself for website creation. 
          Just recently I graduated from Central Penn College where 
          I received an associates degree in application development. 
          ðŸ’¾Currently my platform of choice is React.js and Next.js 
          as it really streamlines production and the speed of loading websites. 
          I feel it is particularly ðŸ›‘important to hone ones skills and I will always look to do the same. 
          </p>
